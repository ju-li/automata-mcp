 *
 * Two passes, because the two sources cost wildly different amounts. Contacts are
 * one cached read that covers every chat at once, so they run first; group
 * membership is a live round trip *per group* and only runs for the groups that
 * still have something unresolved after that.
 *
 * A hit set can span more groups than it is worth waking the socket for, so the
 * second pass is capped, busiest group first — the cap trades a few unnamed
 * senders in the tail for a bounded response time. `read-messages` needs none of
 * this: it is one chat, so it is always exactly one lookup.
 *
 * Best effort throughout, like `chatNames`: an unresolved mention stays a raw id,
 * an unresolved author falls back to the stored push name or to nothing, and a
 * search still answers.
