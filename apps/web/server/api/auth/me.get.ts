 * and an error response would make "signed out" indistinguishable from "the
 * request failed".
 *
 * The organization comes back with it, because every page needs the role and
 * fetching it separately would mean a second round-trip on every navigation.
 *
 * `membership: null` is a real, reachable answer and not an error: a record
 * whose organization was deleted, or one created before this existed. This route
 * therefore does NOT use `requireMembership`, which throws — it reports the
 * state and lets the client route somewhere that explains it. A backend fault
 * still becomes a 503, so an outage is never mistaken for "you were removed".
