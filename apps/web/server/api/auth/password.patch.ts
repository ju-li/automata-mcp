/**
 * Change your own password.
 *
 * `passwordConfirm` is not a field: the "confirm new password" box is a typo
 * guard in the browser and never travels as its own field of truth. A server
 * that trusted a separately-submitted confirmation would be trusting the client
 * to have compared them.
 *
 * Every *other* session this user has is ended, so a session someone opened with
 * the old password does not outlive it; the one making the change stays signed
 * in.
 *
 * This revokes **no connector tokens**, and that is correct rather than an
 * oversight. They are minted by this app, stored only as hashes in `mcp_tokens`,
 * and have nothing to do with this password. A leaked connector token is
 * answered by rotating that token. The dialog says so, because "I changed my
 * password" otherwise reads as having closed every door.
