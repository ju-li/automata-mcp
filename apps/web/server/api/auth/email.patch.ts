/**
 * Change your own email address.
 *
 * With email verification on (`server/utils/email-verification.ts`) the new
 * address gets a code and a link, and nothing changes until one comes back: an
 * account must not be able to take an address it does not own — someone else's
 * pending invitation included. The answer is `{ pending: true }` and the old
 * address keeps working meanwhile. The taken-address check still runs first,
 * so a signed-in user is told plainly rather than mailing the address's owner.
 *
 * With it off (no SMTP in `auto` mode, or `off`) the password proof is all
 * there is, as before: a change that waited on a mail this deployment cannot
 * send would leave the user waiting for a message nobody can deliver.
 *
 * The address is stored through `normaliseEmail()`, the same function invitation
 * acceptance compares against. Getting that wrong would make a pending
 * invitation for `Foo@Bar.com` unmatchable by an account that had just set its
 * address to exactly that.
 *
 * One consequence the person typing cannot see, so it is written down here: an
 * invitation addressed to their **old** address stops being redeemable by this
 * account, and one addressed to the **new** address starts being.
