/**
 * Every message on a messaging connection, as one searchable, paged table — the
 * dashboard's Messages card.
 *
 * Search and paging are done in SQL over the whole account, never over rows a
 * client has fetched: a `Message` table runs to six figures, so a page has to be
 * a page of everything, and a search that only saw the current page would be a
 * search that quietly answers about the wrong set.
 *
 * Ordering is by time alone, and that is a limit rather than an omission —
 * `listAccountMessages` explains why a name column cannot be sorted here.
 *
 * A connection with no database URL is refused by the same precedence rule the
 * MCP read path uses, and with the same two answers it gives: a 500 naming the
 * missing deployment-wide setting, or a 501 for a connection on a server of the
 * user's own that has no database URL of its own. Never an empty page — "I
 * cannot read this" and "there is nothing here" are different answers. The
 * dashboard does not normally reach either: `canReadMessages` is false in both
 * cases, and the card that opens this table is not clickable then.
