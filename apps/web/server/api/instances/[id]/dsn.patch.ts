 * Replace a database connection's connection string.
 *
 * Proved before it is stored, for the same reason creating one is: a DSN that
 * does not work should be a failed edit with a message about the DSN, not a
 * connection that silently stops answering. The pool is dropped afterwards so
 * the change takes effect immediately rather than at the next fingerprint
 * check — belt and braces, since `pgFor` would notice on its own.
 *
 * Every token on this connection keeps working, deliberately. The tokens name
 * *this connection*, not this credential; making an owner reissue them because
 * a password rotated would be a reason not to rotate it.
