 * as tokens did before scoping existed.
 *
 * Enforcement happens in two different places, because they have to:
 *
 *   tools  `enabled(event)` on each tool definition. The toolkit evaluates it
 *          before building the request's MCP server, so a disallowed tool is
 *          never registered — `tools/call` fails just like `tools/list` omits
 *          it. This is real enforcement, not hiding.
 *   chats  inside handlers. `enabled` cannot see tool arguments, and the chat a
 *          call targets is an argument.
