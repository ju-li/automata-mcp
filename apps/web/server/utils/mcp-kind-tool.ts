 * **This registry is the answer to a question the toolkit cannot answer for
 * us.** A tool's `group` used to double as "which kind this belongs to", which
 * worked only while the two were the same string. They are not any more: the
 * SQL tools sit in `tools/sql/` and serve every SQL kind, so `group` is `'sql'`
 * and names no kind at all.
 *
 * `api/instances/[id]/mcp-tools.get.ts` needs the mapping to render the scope
 * picker, and reading it off the toolkit's own definition meant an untyped cast
 * through `group ?? _meta.group` — which did not typecheck, and which would
 * have silently returned an empty catalogue the moment `group` stopped being a
 * kind. A picker that offers no tools mints a token that can call nothing.
 *
 * Populated as each tool module evaluates. Every tool module is imported by the
 * toolkit's generated `tools.mjs`, and the route imports that, so by the time
 * any request is served every `defineKindTool` call has run.

/**
 * Define an MCP tool that belongs to one or more kinds of connection.
 *
 * **Why this exists rather than three separate declarations.** A tool's kind was
 * being asserted three times per file — by the directory it sits in, by an
 * explicit `group`, and by the third argument to `isToolAllowed` — kept in step
 * by a comment. Only the third one enforces anything, and forgetting it is not a
 * cosmetic slip: a Postgres token minted with `all_tools` would register
 * `send-text-message`, whose handler calls `useEvolutionClient()` on a row that
 * has no Evolution credentials. Declaring the kind once makes the mismatch
 * unrepresentable.
 *
 * **`kinds` (plural) is for a tool whose meaning is genuinely identical across
 * engines**, which today means the SQL tools: `run-query` takes the same
 * argument and promises the same thing whether the connection is Postgres or
 * another SQL engine, and the differences live behind `sql-engine.ts` and in the
 * per-kind `instructions`. It is *not* the way to share a tool whose arguments
 * differ — that is why Telegram has `read-telegram-messages` rather than a
 * two-kind `read-messages`, and that reasoning still stands.
 *
 * Basenames must stay unique across groups regardless: the loader warns on a
 * collision and `McpServer.registerTool` throws on a duplicate registered name.
 * A single shared file satisfies that rule rather than straining it.
 *
 * `available` is the second half of the old `enabled` expression, kept for the
 * one tool that has a prerequisite beyond its kind. It takes no event because a
 * prerequisite is a property of the deployment, not of the caller.
