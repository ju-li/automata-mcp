/**
 * The hosted offering, as the web app sees it: one switch and one client.
 *
 * Everything that sells plans — Stripe, Checkout, the webhook, seat billing —
 * lives in the separate cloud service (`apps/cloud`). The web app knows none of
 * it. It enforces limits from its own columns (entitlements.ts), records
 * account changes in the outbox (hosted-events.ts), and forwards the Billing
 * page's requests here. A self-hosted deployment sets none of this and runs
 * with no plans, no limits and no events.
 *
 * **Hosted mode** is `NUXT_CLOUD_URL` set. `NUXT_BILLING`, which phase one of
 * this split used, is still read so a hosted deployment that upgrades without
 * setting the new variables fails closed — plans stay on, Billing answers 503
 * and the startup log says what to set — rather than quietly handing every new
 * organization unlimited use.

 * (none existed on the hosted service when this was added); refusing it at
 * request time would read as an outage and mail everyone who uses it.
