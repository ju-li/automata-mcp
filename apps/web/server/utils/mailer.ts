/**
 * Outbound email, over SMTP from this process.
 *
 * Configured from `NUXT_SMTP_*`. With `NUXT_SMTP_HOST` unset nothing is sent:
 * alerts are still computed, `sendAppEmail` answers false, and the callers that
 * care (the alert bookkeeping, the invitation dialog) treat that as "not
 * delivered" — an alert stays queued for the next sweep, and an invitation's
 * link is still on screen to copy.
 *
 * `NUXT_SMTP_TLS=true` is implicit TLS (port 465). False sends STARTTLS when the
 * server offers it, which is what port 587 wants.
 *
 * Account emails (verification, already registered, email-change notice,
 * invitation, password reset, password-changed notice) are HTML with a
 * plain-text alternative, written by the templates in `server/emails/`.
 * Connection alerts are still plain text.
