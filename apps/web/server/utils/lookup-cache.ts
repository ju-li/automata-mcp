/**
 * A short-lived cache for a lookup that can be unavailable rather than empty.
 *
 * Both Evolution lookups that go through Baileys — a group's subject, a group's
 * participants — share an awkward shape. They are live round trips to WhatsApp,
 * so they are slow and they never answer at all while the account is
 * disconnected; they are asked for repeatedly, because a picker refetches on
 * every open and an MCP client may call `list-chats` in a loop; and their
 * answers change on a human timescale, so a stale one is nearly always right.
 *
 * `chats.ts` and `mentions.ts` had a copy of this each, five constants apiece,
 * with `mentions.ts` documenting its copy as "cached and guarded exactly like
 * `fetchGroups` in `chats.ts`, and for the same reasons" — which is this file's
 * reason to exist, written out longhand.
 *
 * Three behaviours, and each is load-bearing:
 *
 *   serve stale   A failed refresh returns the value we had rather than
 *                 dropping to nothing: a name from a minute ago still beats a
 *                 raw id on screen.
 *   cache the     For a shorter window. `findChats` reads Evolution's database
 *   failure       and keeps answering while the account is disconnected —
 *                 exactly when these cannot succeed — so without this every
 *                 caller would pay the full timeout again.
 *   never throw   A caller must still get its messages back when nobody can be
 *                 named, so `load` reports failure as `undefined` and this
 *                 answers with `empty`.
