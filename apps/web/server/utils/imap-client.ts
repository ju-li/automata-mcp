/**
 * Everything that speaks IMAP to a user's mail server: opening a connection,
 * proving credentials, the three things fetched live — a message body, an
 * attachment, a server-side body search — and the one write, appending a
 * draft. The sync (imap-sync.ts) opens its own connections through `openImap`
 * too, so the host guard and TLS rules live once.
 *
 * Rules easy to undo:
 *
 * - **Every connection goes through `assertPublicTarget` and dials the approved
 *   address**, with the original hostname as SNI and the certificate checked
 *   against it. A mail host is a user-chosen outbound target exactly as a DSN
 *   is, so `imap.example.com` resolving to this deployment's Postgres is the
 *   same attack.
 * - **No plaintext.** `starttls` sets `doSTARTTLS: true`, which makes the
 *   upgrade mandatory — imapflow's default would carry on in cleartext when the
 *   server (or someone on the path) omits STARTTLS from its capabilities.
 * - **Every mailbox is opened read-only (EXAMINE), and parts are fetched with
 *   BODY.PEEK.** Reading a message through this connector must not mark it read
 *   in the user's mail client.
 * - **The only write is `appendDraft`: one APPEND, on its own connection.** It
 *   selects no mailbox, so nothing here ever opens one read-write, and it never
 *   stores flags on, moves, copies or expunges an existing message. Sending is
 *   not something this file can do — there is no SMTP here.
 * - **An `error` listener on every client.** imapflow emits `error` on a dropped
 *   socket; an EventEmitter with no listener turns that into an uncaught
 *   exception that takes the whole server down.
 * - **Attachments are never stored.** `downloadAttachment` streams into memory,
 *   capped, and hands the bytes to the caller; nothing here writes to disk or
 *   the database.
