/**
 * What each kind of connection tells a model about itself.
 *
 * These reach the client in the `initialize` response, and most clients paste
 * them into the model's system prompt — so they are written for the facts a
 * model gets wrong, not as a feature list.
 *
 * **Per-request selection is not as simple as it looks.** `mcp.instructions` in
 * nuxt.config is a plain string, and the toolkit resolves the handler config in
 * the FIRST statement of its request handler (`createMcpHandler`,
 * dist/runtime/server/mcp/utils.js:195) — before it calls our auth middleware at
 * :208. So a getter on the handler object fires before `event.context.mcpAuth`
 * exists and would see nothing, every time. The seam that works is the
 * `mcp:config:resolved` hook at :203, which fires inside `next()` on the object
 * that is then handed to `createMcpServer`. See server/plugins/mcp-instructions.ts.
