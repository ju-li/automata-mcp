/**
 * The app's own database: users, sessions, organizations, connections and their
 * credentials, connector tokens.
 *
 * One pool, in the `app` schema of the Postgres this deployment already runs for
 * Evolution (and the Telegram bridge, under `telegram`). Every query names
 * `app.<table>` explicitly rather than trusting a search path — the same rule
 * `telegram-db.ts` follows, for the same reason: the database is shared, and an
 * unqualified name that resolved into `public` would land among Evolution's
 * tables.
 *
 * **This credential is read-write and holds every secret the app has** — every
 * connection's Evolution key and DSN, every token hash, every password hash.
 * It is never handed to anything a user chose: `NUXT_DATABASE_URL` is in
 * net-guard's list of this deployment's own backends, so a user-supplied DSN
 * pointing at it is refused whatever `NUXT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS` says.
 *
 * ── Failure semantics ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A database that cannot be reached answers **503**, never 401, on both auth
 * surfaces. With PocketBase the hard part was telling "no such row" from "no
 * such collection" (both 404); here a query that finds nothing returns an empty
 * array and a fault throws, so the distinction comes for free. Keep it: any auth
 * read that catches a throw must turn it into `appDbUnavailable()`, never into
 * `undefined`.
 *
 * ── Row shape ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Rows come back with `NULL` as `undefined` and timestamps as ISO strings, so
 * the `App*` types below can say `?: string` and mean it, and a row serialises to
 * JSON the way the UI has always received it.
