/**
 * Entitlements: what an organization may hold, and the checks that hold it to
 * that. The only limit enforcement in the app.
 *
 * This file knows numbers, not plans. `app.organizations.max_connections`,
 * `max_tokens` and `max_members` say how many of each an organization may
 * have; NULL is unlimited. Nothing here names a plan, a price or a payment
 * provider — whatever sells plans writes the columns (today `stripe.ts` via
 * `applyPlanEntitlements()` in billing.ts, later the separate cloud service)
 * and this file only reads them. On a self-hosted deployment every column is
 * NULL, so every check here passes and nothing is limited, with no setting to
 * get right.
 *
 * Why enforcement stays in the web app even once selling plans moves out: the
 * checks run inside the app's own transactions, under the organization row
 * lock, and on every MCP request. A call to another service there would put
 * that service's outage on the auth path and turn "valid token, backend
 * down" into a refusal. Reading a column keeps the rule every auth read here
 * follows: a fault is a 503, never a refusal.
 *
 * Two behaviours, both deterministic:
 *
 * - **Adding beyond a limit is refused** with 402 `plan_limit` (`assertCanAdd`),
 *   checked under the organization row lock so two racing adds take turns.
 * - **Holding beyond a limit deletes nothing.** An organization whose limits
 *   dropped — a lapsed subscription — keeps everything. On the MCP surface only
 *   the oldest `max_tokens` live tokens on its oldest `max_connections`
 *   connections answer (`mcpLimitRefusal`); the rest get 403, never 401, and
 *   come back unchanged when the limits rise again.
