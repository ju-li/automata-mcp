/**
 * The one place that decides which SQL engine a connection speaks.
 *
 * Every tool in `server/mcp/tools/sql/` and the two database API routes go
 * through here and never name an engine, which is what lets one tool set serve
 * more than one kind. Adding an engine means adding an arm to each function
 * below and nothing at the call sites.
 *
 * **Dispatch functions rather than an adapter interface, deliberately.** An
 * interface would make each method's doc comment the union of every engine's
 * contract, and put the guard reasoning behind a boundary where a reader at the
 * call site can no longer see which checks ran — and `pg-guard.ts`'s header is
 * a security argument written for one engine, which cannot be written once for
 * two. The exhaustiveness is a wash (a `Record<SqlKind, …>` and a `switch …
 * assertNever` both fail to compile on a new engine); what a switch adds is
 * that an engine-specific option produces a compile error at the dispatch site
 * rather than a silently ignored field.
 *
 * `sqlKindOf` follows `alertableKind()` in `alerts.ts` — this repo already has
 * that idiom for "the kinds that share a capability".
