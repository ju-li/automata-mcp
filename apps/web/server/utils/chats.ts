 *   timer, a key exchange, a history-sync notification. No body, nothing a
 *   caller can act on, so it is dropped and counted. The exception is
 *   `type: 14` (MESSAGE_EDIT), which nests the whole edited message. That one
 *   must survive: Evolution's live path skips top-level protocol messages
 *   entirely, so these rows come only from history sync, where nothing patches
 *   the original — the edit row is the *only* copy of the new text.
 * - `associatedChildMessage` wraps a real message (see `WRAPPER_KEYS`). Unwrap
 *   it; filtering it would delete album media and captioned video outright.
 * - `secretEncryptedMessage` is an encrypted edit and stays, labelled — see
 *   `UnreadableReason`.
 *
 * Takes the payload *and* the type hint, and trusts the payload: `messageType` is
 * `getContentType()` verbatim and describes the outermost key, so it names the
 * wrapper rather than the content.
 *
 * None of this can move into the query, which is why the drop is local. Filtering
 * on `messageType` would be filtering on the wrapper — and even reading the
 * payload in SQL, excluding `protocolMessage` there would delete every edit along
 * with the bookkeeping, while `associatedChildMessage` has to be kept outright.
 * So `total` counts rows this function then discards, and the count is reported
