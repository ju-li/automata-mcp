  //
  // A token names a member and a connection. It authenticates only while that
  // member is still in the connection's organization and still reaches the
  // connection — so removing someone, or unassigning a connection from them,
  // kills their tokens on the very next request even if an explicit revoke was
  // missed. That is the whole reason this is read live and neither cached nor
  // denormalized onto the token: a cache would delay exactly the effect this
  // exists to produce, and a copied `org` would go stale on every one of those
  // transitions.

  // One query for the token and the facts about its holder, then the instance
  // row by primary key. Failure semantics, which are the point of this block:
