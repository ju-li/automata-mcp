/**
 * The signed-in user and their organization, shared across the app.
 *
 * The browser never talks to PocketBase — the session cookie is `httpOnly`, so
 * the only way to know who is signed in is to ask the server. This caches that
 * answer in `useState` so it survives hydration and is fetched once per load
 * rather than once per navigation.
 *
 * `membership` comes back on the same request rather than from a second one:
 * the role decides what almost every page renders, so fetching it separately
 * would put an extra round-trip on every navigation.
 *
 * `isAdmin` gates UI only. Every action it hides is independently refused by the
 * server, and nothing here is a security boundary — a member who unhides a
 * button gets a 403, not an action.
