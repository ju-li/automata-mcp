 * Session gate. Authentication, plus the two routing decisions that depend on
 * the organization.
 *
 * It deliberately does not look at a connection's live state — that would put an
 * Evolution round-trip, or a database connection, on every navigation.
 * `/instances` sends you to `/instances/new` when you have none, and the
 * per-connection page picks its panel from the connection's kind.
 *
 * The organization checks cost nothing extra: the role arrives on the same
 * `/api/auth/me` response the session already needs.
 *
 * **An invitation link escapes every redirect below.** Someone who has just been
 * removed from an organization, or who has never had one, must be able to open
 * one and accept it — bouncing them to the dead-end page would make the
 * invitation unusable by exactly the people it is for. It is also the one place
 * a signed-in user is not pushed off a public route, because accepting is what
 * they came to do.
 *
 * Role-based redirects, here and in the pages, are **convenience only**. Every
 * one of them is independently enforced server-side; unhiding a control in the
 * browser gets you a 403, not an action.
