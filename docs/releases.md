# Releases

The three images built from this repo are published to GHCR when `main` is
merged into `prod`:

| Image | Built from | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `ghcr.io/ju-li/automata-mcp-web` | `apps/web/Dockerfile` | `docker-compose.yml`, Railway |
| `ghcr.io/ju-li/automata-mcp-telegram-bridge` | `apps/telegram-bridge/Dockerfile` | `docker-compose.yml`, Railway |
| `ghcr.io/ju-li/automata-mcp-aio` | `docker/aio/Dockerfile` | [single container](self-hosting.md#single-container) |

The all-in-one image builds the web app and the bridge from the same commit as
the other two, on top of Evolution's pinned image, so one version names the same
code in all three.

Each release is tagged `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y`, `X`, `latest` and `sha-<commit>`, for
`linux/amd64`. **Point a service or a template at the major tag (`:1`), not
`:latest`.** The web service migrates its schema at boot and migrations only go
forward, so a major release reaching a deployment on its next restart is not
something to opt into by accident.

The version is `"version"` in the root `package.json`, always three-part. Three
directory listings repeat it — `server.json` (official MCP Registry),
`lhm.plugin.json` (LobeHub Marketplace) and `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`
(cursor.directory) — so set all four with one command rather than by hand. To cut a release:

1. On `main`, through an ordinary PR, run `pnpm release:version X.Y.Z` and
   commit the four files it changes.
2. Open a PR from `main` into `prod`. The `release-check` workflow refuses it
   unless the version is `X.Y.Z`, is not already released, is above the latest
   release, and matches in all four files, and unless `lhm.plugin.json` lists
   exactly the tools in `apps/web/server/mcp/tools/`. It also builds all three
   images to prove they still build.
3. Merge it with **Create a merge commit** — never squash, or `prod` stops being
   an ancestor of `main` and every later release PR shows old commits again.
   The `release` workflow then pushes all three images and only after that creates
   the `vX.Y.Z` git tag and the GitHub Release, so a tag always means its images
   exist. Last, it publishes `server.json` to the official MCP Registry; if that
   step fails the release still stands, and re-running the job is safe.
4. Once the new web image is deployed, update the LobeHub listing by hand (its
   CLI logs in through a browser, so no workflow can):

   ```bash
   npx -y @lobehub/market-cli plugin update --dir "$PWD"
   ```

   Run `npx -y @lobehub/market-cli login` first if it says the session expired.

## Directory listings

| Directory | File | Published by |
|---|---|---|
| [Official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) (`app.getautomata/automata`) | `server.json` | `release.yml`, every release |
| [LobeHub Marketplace](https://lobehub.com/mcp) (`ju-li-automata-mcp`) | `lhm.plugin.json` | by hand, step 4 above |
| [Docker MCP Catalog](https://hub.docker.com/mcp) | `servers/automata/` in `docker/mcp-registry` | a PR there; carries no version |
| [cursor.directory](https://cursor.directory) | `mcp.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` | read from this repository; version set by `release:version` |

**When a tool is added, renamed or removed,** the release check fails until
`lhm.plugin.json` lists it. Deploy first, then regenerate from the live server
card (the JSON Schemas exist only at runtime) and commit the result:

```bash
pnpm listings:tools https://mcp.getautomata.app/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json
```

The Docker catalog's `tools.json` is a separate snapshot in that repository and
needs a follow-up PR there; nothing checks it.

One-time setup on GitHub, which no workflow can do for you:

- Add the repository secret `MCP_REGISTRY_DNS_KEY`: the hex Ed25519 private
  key whose public key is in the `v=MCPv1; k=ed25519; p=…` TXT record on the
  apex of `getautomata.app`. Derive it from the `key.pem` used to create that
  record:

  ```bash
  openssl pkey -in key.pem -noout -text | grep -A3 "priv:" | tail -n +2 | tr -d ' :\n'
  ```

  Keep the TXT record in place for as long as releases publish; removing it
  makes the `mcp-registry` job fail. Rotating the key means a new TXT record and
  a new secret together.

- Create the `prod` branch from `main`, and protect it: require a pull request
  and the `release-check` jobs (`version`, `build`).
- After the first release, open each package under the repository's
  **Packages** and set its visibility to **Public**. GHCR creates packages
  private, and Railway — or anyone deploying a template or running the
  all-in-one image — cannot pull a private image without credentials.
  `automata-mcp-aio` appears only after the first release that includes it, and
  needs the same step then.
