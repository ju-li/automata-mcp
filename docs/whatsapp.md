# WhatsApp connections

## Reading and searching messages

`NUXT_EVOLUTION_DATABASE_URL` is **required** for accounts on this deployment's
Evolution server. Both `read-messages` and `search-messages` read Evolution's
Postgres directly, and neither can answer without it — pairing, `list-chats` and
`send-text-message` still work, and the app says so once at startup. It is the one
part of this app that does not go through the Evolution API, for two separate
reasons.

**Searching.** Evolution 2.3.7 cannot search message content. `POST
/chat/findMessages` accepts a `where.message` — its request schema even documents
the field — and then never reads it, so a content search comes back as an
unfiltered page that looks like a result set. The only filters it honours are
`id`, `source`, `messageType`, a `messageTimestamp` range, and
`key.{id,remoteJid,fromMe,participant}`. Reading the database instead also reaches
text WhatsApp stores a level or two down — an album item's caption under
`associatedChildMessage`, an edit's new wording under
`protocolMessage.editedMessage` — which no top-level extractor could see.

**Reading.** Evolution stores a message more than once. Its history import
deduplicates against an in-memory set of message ids rebuilt at the start of each
batch, and the `createMany` behind it asks to skip duplicates — which does
nothing, because the only unique constraint on `Message` is a generated primary
key that cannot collide. So two batches in flight together, or an import racing
live traffic, both insert; re-pairing an account is what puts them in flight. The
copies disagree about who sent the message, because each carries whatever push
name was on the wire at the time — a real name, a bare LID, or the sender's own
device-locale word for themselves. Left alone, one message is three, a five-day
range reports triple the messages it holds, and pages come back ragged. The
endpoint cannot fix it: it pages with `skip`/`take` over the duplicate rows, so
the page boundaries are already wrong by the time anything could collapse them.
`DISTINCT ON (key->>'id')` before `LIMIT` is the fix, and that means SQL.

Reactions are dropped in the same query, on the payload rather than on
`messageType`. WhatsApp's own control records cannot be — `messageType` carries no
subtype, and excluding `protocolMessage` wholesale would delete every message edit
along with the bookkeeping — so those are dropped after the rows are read and
counted back to the caller as `protocolMessagesExcluded`.

**Which credential.** The same URL as `NUXT_DATABASE_URL` works, and it is what
the [Railway setup](deploy-railway.md) uses. Every query the app sends here is fixed SQL with
bound parameters — nothing a model or a user writes reaches this connection as
SQL — and the pool opens each session with `default_transaction_read_only`, so a
write fails even under a superuser. That setting is a backstop, not a boundary: a
superuser can switch it off, but only through SQL, and the app never sends any it
did not write.

```bash
NUXT_EVOLUTION_DATABASE_URL=postgres://evolution:change-me@localhost:5432/evolution
```

**Optional hardening: a role that can do nothing else.** This connection reaches
every user's messages in every instance. A dedicated role does not protect them
from a compromised web service — that process already holds `NUXT_DATABASE_URL`,
the database's owner — but it does contain a bug in the app's own message queries
to reading `"Message"`, where under the owner such a bug would reach every stored
credential in the `app` schema. If you want that, the one grant below serves both
reading and searching:

```sql
CREATE ROLE wamcp_search LOGIN PASSWORD 'change-me';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE evolution TO wamcp_search;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO wamcp_search;
GRANT SELECT ON "Message" TO wamcp_search;
```

```bash
NUXT_EVOLUTION_DATABASE_URL=postgres://wamcp_search:change-me@localhost:5432/evolution
```

Evolution ships `@@index([instanceId])` and nothing else — no index on
`messageTimestamp`, none on the `key` JSONB — so reading and searching are both a
sequential scan within one account. History import makes that corpus much larger than it would
otherwise be: a number with years of conversations arrives all at once at
pairing, rather than accumulating. The queries carry a 10-second
`statement_timeout` so a slow scan surfaces as an error instead of a hung MCP
call. Once a scan starts timing out, add (as a Postgres superuser, not as the
app):

```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS message_instance_ts_idx
  ON "Message" ("instanceId", "messageTimestamp" DESC);
```

Worth knowing before you go looking for a bug:

- Both cover whatever Evolution holds: the history imported at pairing plus
  everything since. An account paired before full-history sync was turned on has
  only what arrived after — see [Importing existing history](#importing-existing-history).
- Reads are deduplicated by message id, so `totalMatching` counts distinct
  messages and can be quoted as an answer. It will often be smaller than the row
  count Evolution's own API reports for the same range. The two are not
  comparable, and the smaller one is the true one.
- **The dashboard's chat count and `list-chats` count different things.** The
  count is every conversation the phone listed at pairing; `list-chats` lists
  conversations Evolution holds messages for, which is routinely fewer. The gap
  is not more pages — `hasMore` is the only signal that there are.
- The scope editor lists the tools of the connection's own kind, and lists both
  read tools whether or not the database URL is set. It deliberately does not
  hide a tool with an unmet prerequisite: both read tools need that URL, so
  hiding one would leave a scope editor that disagrees with the tool list a
  client actually sees. An unset URL is reported at startup instead.
- **A connection on your own Evolution server needs its own database URL.** This
  variable names one database — the one belonging to the Evolution server this
  app is configured with — and a bring-your-own connection's messages live in
  that server's database instead. Supply it when creating the connection, or from
  its dashboard afterwards (**Enable reading**); it is stored on the connection,
  not here. Until then reads answer 501 naming the missing setting rather than
  matching nothing and reporting an empty conversation. Pairing, chat listing and
  sending never need it.

  Same shape of role as above, in *your* database:

  ```sql
  CREATE ROLE evo_reader LOGIN PASSWORD 'change-me';
  GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE evolution TO evo_reader;
  GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO evo_reader;
  GRANT SELECT ON "Message" TO evo_reader;
  ```

  It is checked before it is stored — including that `"Message"` is actually
  readable, because a URL that connects to the *wrong* database is otherwise
  indistinguishable from an account with no messages.

On Railway, Evolution's Postgres is its own service — use its private URL, and
note the port there is whatever that service actually listens on (see "Pin the
ports").

## Importing existing history

WhatsApp hands over past conversations **once**, in a burst it pushes while a
device is being linked. There is no endpoint — here or upstream — that fetches
history afterwards. Evolution exposes `/chat/findMessages`, but that reads
Evolution's own Postgres, not WhatsApp.

Three things have to line up, and two of them have to be true *before* the QR is
scanned:

| | Where | Effect if wrong |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_SAVE_DATA_HISTORIC=true` | evolution service env | Evolution receives the burst and drops it |
| `syncFullHistory: true` | sent at `POST /instance/create`, in `server/utils/instances.ts` | Only recent messages arrive, and groups are skipped |
| A fresh device link | scanning the QR | Reconnecting an existing session sends no history |

New accounts get all three automatically. An account paired before this was
turned on cannot be backfilled in place — **Import full history** on the
connection's dashboard sets the flag, signs the device out and puts the QR back
up; the import rides in on the re-scan. Nothing already stored is lost: Evolution
skips messages whose `key.id` it already has, so re-importing merges rather than
duplicates.

Watch it land with `pnpm services:logs` while scanning:

```
recv 412 chats, 1180 contacts, 39204 msgs (is latest: false, progress: 34%), type: 2
```

`type: 2` is a full sync, `type: 3` is the recent-only one. Anything but `2` means
`syncFullHistory` never reached the socket.

Caveats worth knowing before you rely on it:

- **Media is not downloaded.** History gives message records; the bytes still need
  `getBase64FromMediaMessage` per message.
- **Depth is whatever the phone volunteers.** `syncFullHistory` asks for
  everything; it is not a guarantee of everything.
- **Groups come too.** `syncFullHistory` overrides Evolution's group filter, so
  group chats appear in `list-chats` and in the token scope picker.
- **Reads get slower as it grows.** Evolution indexes its `Message` table on
  `instanceId` only; `remoteJid` lives inside a JSONB column with no index.

## Bring your own Evolution server

A WhatsApp connection can be created against a user's own Evolution server: the
create form takes the base URL and that server's `AUTHENTICATION_API_KEY`, and
the app provisions an instance on it exactly as it does on the default server.
Both halves or neither — half a configuration is never completed from this
deployment's own, because sending our global key to a server someone else
controls would hand them every account on ours.

With `NUXT_EVOLUTION_URL` and `NUXT_EVOLUTION_ADMIN_KEY` unset there is no
default server, and supplying one becomes required to create a WhatsApp
connection. Everything else in the app still works.

Server URLs are compared by origin, so a trailing slash on `NUXT_EVOLUTION_URL`
does not reclassify this deployment's own connections as bring-your-own. If a
connection's server has no global key available any more — the variables were
unset, or the row no longer matches the configured server — deleting it still
removes the row and its tokens, and logs the instance left behind on that server.

## ⚠️ WhatsApp pairing burns a real phone number

Scanning the QR binds a real WhatsApp account to an instance. WhatsApp rate-limits
and can ban numbers that pair and unpair repeatedly, or that send unsolicited
messages from a freshly-paired session. **Use a spare SIM, not your primary
number**, and keep test traffic to conversations you control.

Routine restarts must never use `docker compose down -v` — see [Self-hosting](self-hosting.md).
